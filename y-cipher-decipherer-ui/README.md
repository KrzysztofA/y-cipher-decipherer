UI for the Cipher Decipherer App, made with CreateReactApp served as my first
app made in react. Powered by backend in Node.JS that computes Cipher values
using multithreaded linear algebra. UI is rather basic but serves its purpose.

#TODO Testing, check for other cleanup possibilities, merge UI and Backend
