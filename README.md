# Y-Cipher-Decipherer

Application deciphering coded messages with Hill Cipher, Caesar Cipher, and
Rails Cipher, created for assignment submission in the first year Mathematics
course in computing module. Application made with React for Front-End and NodeJS
with Express for Back-End

## Stack

- _React_ **18.2**
- _NodeJS_ **16.13**
- _Express_ **4.18**

## Background

Application created for purpose of 1st year Mathematics Course - Thinking Like A
Programmer Module (Computing Module).

Course work expected us to create a script reading message encoded with Hill
Cipher using Matlab or Python. For personal curiosity, and as at the time I was
learning JavaScript and NodeJS, I decided to implement an app using these
technologies. Initially I also created GUI in vanilla JavaScript, which was
flawed. While learning React I decided to refresh the GUI and fix all the issues
that API had, including bottling up code and reducing operation count.

### Ciphers

Application can decipher selection of Ciphers:

- Hill Cipher

- Caesar Cipher

- Rails Cipher

## Mathematics

Mathematics behind the hill cipher revolve around mathematics of modulus.
Modulus is branch of mathematics with operations revolved around division
remainders. Letters are a special and very unfavourable case of modulus, as 26
is not a prime number. 26 can be divided by 13, meaning that there are 2
possible values for each letter (eg. A can take value of 1 and 13, and so can
M). Another important mathematics field that is included in Hill Cipher is
linear algebra, and matrix multiplication.

## Features

- Responsive UI
- **ARIA** Support

## Deployment and Usage

## Final Words

As part of gamification of my work I assigned the following scores to this
project, with related justification:

- Satisfaction: 4 The project, although was very satisfying when I first worked
  on it, now seems to be lacking. It is not a new project, therefore the
  satisfaction score is biased by the prism of projects I worked on since then.
- Difficulty: 2 Although learning this project was fairly difficult, it has
  hardly anything more than a boilerplate code. Deciphering attempted ciphers is
  a polynomial problem and the algorithms are well covered in various pieces.
  CreateReactApp and React code included is also very basic.
- Challange: 3 The project was not very challenging, learning new technologies
  turned out to be very simple. Attempt to follow the best practices upped the
  challange slightly.
- Complexity: 4 The project uses 3 different algorithms and React with couple of
  custom hooks. The codebase is relatively small, and the project is not
  extended of any extra functionality.
